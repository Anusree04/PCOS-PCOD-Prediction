# PCOS-PCOD-Prediction
1. Objective
To develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) or Polycystic Ovary Disorder (PCOD) based on clinical and lifestyle data. The model aims to assist early diagnosis and support healthcare professionals.

2. Problem Statement
PCOS/PCOD is a common endocrine disorder among women of reproductive age. Early detection can prevent complications such as infertility, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. By leveraging machine learning, we can analyze patterns in patient data to predict PCOS/PCOD risk and provide timely interventions.
3. Algorithm used
   Random forest algorithm with accuracy 83%
